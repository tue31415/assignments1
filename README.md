This archive contains the data and useful scripts for Set1 homeworks.

It contains the MNIST data set that was downloaded from the e-book by Michael Nielsen: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). The dataset description and the dataset in its original formal can be found at [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  

The corresponding code for loading the data is located in "**mnist_dataloader.py**".  It allows you load and manipulate data much faster.
